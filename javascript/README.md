# JavaScript
  
Javascript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language

Java script is one of the three core technologies of web development

Client side: traditionally used
Server side: possible due to nodeJS

React and Angular are 100% based on Javascript.
Hence, you need to learn javascript in order to use them.


## JavaScript Language Basics
Variable : a piece of memory which stores data 
- Number
- String
- Boolean : true or false 
- Undefinded : does not have a value yet
- Null : non existent 
```javascript
var firstName = 'John'; // String 
console.log(firstName);

var age = 18; // Number
var isYoung = true; // Boolean 
var job;   
console.log(job); // Undefined 
```


## Functions 
```javascript
function calculateAge(birthYear){
    return 2019 - birthYear;
}
var myAge = caculcateAge(1997);
// 1990 is taken as birthYear in calculateAge function. and the result will be stored in age variable. 
```
